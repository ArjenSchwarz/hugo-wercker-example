# Example project for hugo build step

This project is being used to test new features and compatibility for the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) [build step](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/wercker-step-hugo-build) I wrote for use in [Wercker](http://wercker.com).

After running through the build step it generates a very basic [GitHub Pages site](http://hugo-wercker.ig.nore.me).
